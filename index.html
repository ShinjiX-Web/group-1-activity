                <h2>By Joyce Kilmer</h2>
                <p>I think that I shall never see
                    A poem lovely as a tree.</p>
                <p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
                    Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;</p>
                <p>A tree that looks at God all day,
                      And lifts her leafy arms to pray</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
                    Who intimately lives with rain.</p>
                <p></p>
